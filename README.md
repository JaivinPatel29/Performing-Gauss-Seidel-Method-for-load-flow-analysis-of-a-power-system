# Performing-Gauss-Seidel-Method-for-load-flow-analysis-of-a-power-system
The instructions to feed any generic data file for user are given in the sample data file lfdata.
Load flow for a power system is done by using Gauss-Seidel method.
Load flow data file is asked from user through which bus impedance matrix(ybus) is generated which is further used in the iteration process.
Seperate program named ybus is used to generate the bus impedance matrix to make the program generic of all datasets.
For the sample data file lfdata, the system converges at 33 iterations as tolerance limit is breaked.
